# organic-Rankine-cycle
Contains programs for computation analysis of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with different working fluids (pure and mixed), expander inlet temperatures, and pump outlet pressures. Some programs for ORC without economizer, and others for ORC with economizer. (Programs may be in MATLAB, and invoke REFPROP for physical properties of substances.)
