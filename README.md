# organic-Rankine-cycle
Contains programs for computational analysis of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with different working fluids (pure and mixed), expander inlet temperatures, and pump outlet pressures. Some programs for ORC without economizer, and others for ORC with economizer. (Programs are in MATLAB, and invoke REFPROP for physical properties of substances used as working fluids.)

Work includes systematic analysis of 75 pure substances, and sample analysis of 16 sample mixtures, as ORC working fluids.

Output graphs are also included here.
